# Secure-Messaging-Application-

Encrypted Messaging Application
This project implements a secure, real-time communication platform using end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to safeguard user privacy and data integrity. Designed for individuals and organizations, it addresses modern cybersecurity challenges by combining advanced cryptographic protocols with a scalable client-server architecture.

Key Features
End-to-End Encryption (E2EE): Messages are encrypted on the sender’s device and decrypted only by the recipient, ensuring no third party—including the server—can access content.
Cryptographic Protocols:
  Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange: Establishes secure shared keys between users to prevent eavesdropping.
  AES-128 Encryption: Secures message content with a symmetric-key algorithm.
  HMAC-SHA256: Verifies message integrity to detect tampering.
Client-Server Architecture: The server manages authentication and message routing without decrypting content, ensuring true E2EE.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Supports real-time messaging with low latency across devices.
Error Handling: Resolves issues like "invalid padding error" through robust key derivation and message formatting.

How It Works
User Authentication: Clients authenticate via the server using secure credentials.
Key Exchange:
  Clients generate public-private key pairs using Diffie-Hellman.
  Shared keys are derived for symmetric encryption.
Message Flow:
  Sender: Encrypts messages with AES-128, signs with HMAC-SHA256, and sends via WebSocket.
  Server: Routes encrypted messages to recipients without decryption.
  Recipient: Decrypts messages using the shared key and verifies integrity.

Future Enhancements
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Transition from CLI to an intuitive UI for broader accessibility.
Multi-Device Support: Sync encrypted chats across devices using secure key storage.
Group Chats: Extend E2EE to group messaging with dynamic key management.

Educational Value
This project demonstrates practical applications of cryptographic principles, serving as a resource for understanding secure communication protocols. It highlights challenges like key management and integrity verification, offering insights for cybersecurity research
